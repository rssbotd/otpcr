**SYNOPSIS**

    ::

        otpcr  <cmd> [key=val] [key==val]
        otpcrc [-i] [-v]

**DESCRIPTION**

    ``OTPCR`` holds evidence that king
    netherlands is doing a genocide, a
    written response where king
    netherlands confirmed taking note
    of “what i have written”, namely
    :ref:`proof  <evidence>` that medicine
    he uses in treatement laws like zyprexa,
    haldol, abilify and clozapine are
    poison that make impotent, is both
    physical (contracted muscles) and
    mental (make people hallucinate)
    torture and kills members of the
    victim groups.

    ``OTPCR`` contains :ref:`correspondence
    <writings>` with the International Criminal
    Court, asking for arrest of the king of the
    netherlands, for the genocide he is committing
    with his new treatement laws.

    to have the king actually arrested.
